Here are beginner-friendly examples for practicing key principles:

1. Usability (Ease of Use)

Example 1: Design a login form with email and password fields.
Ensure it's accessible and provides clear error messages (e.g., "Password must be at least 8 characters").
Add a "Show Password" toggle for better usability.
Tool: Figma, Adobe XD, or even paper and pencil.

2. Accessibility

Example 2: Create a webpage for a restaurant menu.
Use proper contrast ratios (e.g., WCAG standards for text and background colors).
Ensure all buttons are large enough to be tapped on mobile.
Include alt text for images and provide keyboard navigation.

3. Intuitive Navigation

Example 3: Redesign a basic e-commerce homepage.
Create a clear menu structure (Home, Shop, About, Contact).
Add a search bar and categorize products.
Use breadcrumbs to guide users through pages.

4. Visual Hierarchy

Example 4: Design a blog post page.
Use headings (H1, H2, H3) to structure content.
Highlight the call-to-action (e.g., "Subscribe" or "Read More") with color and size.
Experiment with fonts and whitespace for readability.

5. Feedback and Affordance

Example 5: Mockup a button interaction for a form submission.
Include hover states, pressed states, and a loading spinner.
Add a success message or animation when the form is submitted.

6. Consistency

Example 6: Create a style guide for a fictional app.
Define fonts, colors, button styles, and spacing.
Apply these rules to a login page and a dashboard.

7. Empathy Mapping

Example 7: Build an empathy map for a user buying a train ticket online.
Think about what they might be feeling, saying, doing, and hearing during the process.
Identify pain points and areas for improvement.

8. Wireframing

Example 8: Sketch the wireframe of a weather app.
Include essential features: city search, current temperature, forecast, and settings.
Use low-fidelity wireframing tools like Balsamiq or even paper.

9. Testing Prototypes

Example 9: Create a clickable prototype for a task-tracking app.
Test it with friends or family to observe their interactions.
Ask questions like, "What was your first impression?" or "Was it easy to find the task creation feature?"

10. Customer Journey Mapping

Example 10: Map out the journey of a user booking a movie ticket online.
Identify touchpoints (searching for a movie, selecting seats, making payment).
Note emotions and frustrations at each step.
